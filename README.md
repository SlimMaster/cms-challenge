# Your task
This example project is a lightweight version of an CMS component renderer. 
Your task is to create 4 components representing data coming from ./src/mock-data/page.js.
Currently only one component called “Stringifier” is rendering all components coming from the CMS 
(this looks pretty ugly right now ;-)).

## Scripting
Your starting point is ./src/App.js. PageData is passed down to CMSPage container. CMSPage renders the ‘Stringifier’ component.
You have to replace the ‘Stringifier’ with your own solution to render those 4 components differently.
How they will look like is up to. You can just use simple HTML5 representations of them.

## Styling
Try to style your new components a little bit. Your starting point is ./src/scss/base.scss.

# Bonus task
PageData contains seo data. Try to make them appear in the HTML header. 
Feel free to install new packages! You don’t have to reinvent the wheel.

# How to start:
1. Navigate to kruu.com-test.
2. run `yarn install`
3. run `yarn start`

# Result
Please remove the node_modules folder before you send us back a zipped version of your project.
